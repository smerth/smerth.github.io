<h3 id="01-01-javascript-objects-and-json">1.1.1 01-01 Javascript Objects and JSON</h3>

<p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.</p>

<p>JSON objects are composed of key-value pairs. The keys are on the left-hand side and the value of the keys are on the right hand side.</p>

<p>JSON data can be included in a page as a variable.</p>

<p>JavaScript can understand this JSON array as an object that you can then access. You can create an object with this data and then pass it into a JavaScript object using command called JSON.parse.</p>

<p>You can then do things like access any of the items within the object just by typing in something like info.name or info.position or info.courses and then specify an item in the array.</p>

<p>JSON arrays are zero indexed.</p>

<h3 id="01-02-objects-and-json">1.1.2 01-02 Objects and JSON</h3>

<p>Although the JSON format is derived from and looks very much like JavaScript objects, there are some differences between the two. In working with JavaScript applications, we often have to deal with both, so let's take a look at some of the similarities and differences between JavaScript objects and JSON. A JSON declaration is a string with names and value pairs. In JSON, the keys are wrapped in double quotes, not single quotes, so you have to be careful when defining these. Make sure you don't try something like this, or that you forget to put the quotes.</p>

<p>This is not valid JSON. With the quotes it is. JSON keys can be any valid string. That means that you can place hyphens, spaces, and even special characters in your key, but be careful because that makes it harder to access data. I would stick to just underscores in between spaces. Do not use the hyphens. It's better to just use underscores. JSON values have to be one of six data types: strings, numbers, objects, arrays, Booleans-- which is true or false-- or the special value null.</p>

<p>JavaScript objects, on the other hand, can be any valid JavaScript structure. So here, we've created a JavaScript object. It's very close to what the JSON string look like, but you can see some differences. So for example, we're missing the quotations here. This is a valid JavaScript name. So where a JSON string could have something like full, space, name, a JavaScript object has to have something like full_name.</p>

<p>So the quotes on the keys are not going to be necessary on JavaScript objects. A JavaScript object can also be any data type, including a function, which you can't do with JSON. Here we assigned the function literal to a key called getName. That would just execute an alert on a page. It wouldn't do much of anything. You can put a full function as a JavaScript object value. Unlike with the JavaScript object, a JSON object needs to be fed as a string into a variable, and then it has to be parsed into JavaScript.</p>

<p>There's a couple of ways of doing this. You can use the eval function or the newer JSON.parse function. Using Eval has some potential security risks, since someone could theoretically include a script inside some JSON data. JSON parse in considered to be more secure, but it's less compatible with older browsers. There is another function called JSON.stringify that does the opposite of parse. Sometimes it's useful to take an existing JavaScript object and convert it into a string.</p>

<p>It suffers from some of the same compatibility issues as JSON parse. For that reason, a library like jQuery can be a big help, since it takes care of compatibility and parsing for you. For the most part, when you're working within an existing JavaScript file, you'll be working with JavaScript objects or JSON data that has been parsed into an object. It's rare to write pure JSON within JavaScript. JSON will be more useful when reading data from another source.</p>

<h3 id="01-03-creating-simple-data">1.1.3 01-03 Creating Simple Data</h3>

<p>JSON &amp; JavaScript objects are really easy to generate, so let's take a look at some examples of how you would express different types of information in this format. The most common type of data you would express is key and value pairs. They are list of keys with their associated values. Multiple values are separated with commas. So if we want to add something here--I'll just type Return, I'll put a couple of spaces and I'll add another key and then I'll place a value on that key and I would need a comma at the end.</p>

<p>Now notice that the last element doesn't need a comma. You can use whitespace for clarity if you want to, so you can add any number of tabs, spaces, or a carriage returns and it won't affect the object in any way. You don't need quotes on numbers, the values true and false--which are the Booleans--or the special value null. Once the data has been parsed into a variable, it becomes a JavaScript object. The easiest way to access elements in JavaScript is to use dot notation. So you could use info.full_name to access the name of this person.</p>

<p>You can also use the bracket notation, which looks like you're retrieving the value of an array. This is especially useful if for some reason the keys are not using valid JavaScript names. So for example, we can use any normal string value right here. So it can have special characters, even though they're not valid JavaScript names, and then we would have to access them with the bracket notation. But it's probably a good idea to keep to valid JavaScript names so we'd use underscores. We would not use hyphens. Just use underscores and then just alphanumeric values.</p>

<p>Objects can also contain lists which are array-like elements that you can create with brackets. Here we have a list of courses. The items are separated with commas, and again, there's no comma at the end of the list. In this form, you can access these elements with array-like calls using an index number. Remember that arrays in JavaScript, like in many other languages, are 0 indexed. So to get to the second element of the array, you would use info.courses, then in brackets, the value 1. The value of any element can also be an object.</p>

<p>In this form, you can access the element using simpler dot notation. So to get to the YouTube link, you would type info.links.youtube. One problem with objects is that you're not guaranteed that the order you type the objects in is the way they'll be stored by JavaScript in memory. So if you want to guarantee order, make sure you use arrays instead. Writing JSON &amp; JavaScript objects can get pretty complicated. Most of the time JSON will be generated by some application, so we don't have to worry about that too much, but you really have to be careful about your syntax when creating JavaScript objects.</p>

<h3 id="01-04-using-javascript-and-json-tools">1.1.4 01-04 Using Javascript and JSON Tools</h3>

<p>The format for JSON &amp; JavaScript objects is super simple: just a bunch of commas, semicolons, a bracket every now and then. However, it's super easy to make a mistake, so it's very easy to go ahead and forget, like, to close one of the quotations or not put one of these colons here or forget not to put a comma on the last element of an object. So, it's a really good idea to have your JavaScript be checked by different tools, and there's a lot of stuff online that can help you make your code a little bit better.</p>

<p>So the first one is a tool called JS Hint, and it's an online tool for validating JavaScript and checking the quality of your code. So it's not really just for JSON or JavaScript objects; you can really just paste your code in here and it will check it for any possible errors. Let me go back to the other page and just grab my JavaScript code, and I'll copy this and I'll come over here and paste it. Then we'll hit this Lint button and see what it says. It says that it has found some problems. So, let's take a look at the problems.</p>

<p>So it's saying that the variable info is defined but never used, and that's really not an error; it's just that it's super opinionated and because I've just created a variable that I'm not calling--because that's not a real page like this is not a real quote that I'm going to use in a real program. It's just a demo to show you how to access a variable. It's complaining that I'm actually not using this variable anywhere. So you can actually modify this tool to not be as picky as it normally is. So you could maybe click off when a variable is undefined or a variable is defined but not used.</p>

<p>If you check that off and you check this again, it's not going to complain about the code anymore. So this tool is a little bit picky, but it's really good for checking not just JSON or JavaScript objects, but just checking your entire JavaScript code. Now, another tool that you can use is called JSONLint. This is really a JSON validator. So it's meant to look at only JSON files, not JavaScript documents. So if I paste this in here--and I'm going to hit Validate--it's going to find an error because this is not really JSON. This is actually JavaScript.</p>

<p>So I need to modify this to make sure that it doesn't have a semicolon and it doesn't have the variable. So I'll hit Validate, and it's telling me that it's a valid JSON. This would be really cool if you were trying to make sure that you didn't do something like forget one of these quotes and when you hit Validate, it's going to try to find the error for you and tell you that there is an error on line 6. So this is a really good idea to check if you're typing in your own JSON, to make sure that you've done everything correctly. Also if your JSON is being generated by some sort of PHP script, then you can pass that along here and it will verify that you've made all the changes correctly.</p>

<p>Notice that you can also put a URL. So if you're trying to check the validity of a PHP script that generates JSON, then you can just paste the URL and it will check that as well. So by far, my favorite editor is actually something called JSON Editor Online. You can see it right here. It's super powerful. It already gives you some sample data so you could see that you could traverse objects just like you can in the console, and you can make modifications to things. So you can say here Pete Smith, and you can go from this side of the screen to the other side of the screen, so you can make the modifications permanently in your JSON document by hitting this button, or you can modify something here and hit this button and it will transfer to this view right here.</p>

<p>So you can look at the object just like you would in the console. Plus, it has a lot of other really cool options. So another thing that I like is that it lets you just minify your JSON. It takes care of removing all the white spaces by hitting this button right here. You can also add the spaces back in, kind of indent everything properly, by hitting this button. So this is actually an excellent tool for checking out your schema, the structure of your JSON documents, as you're designing them.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of tools that you can use offline. You should always have an offline tool, just in case you're on a plane trip or you're not sure what kind of connectivity or you're visiting your cousin from Topeka who doesn't have a connection or somebody that has a really slow connection. So you probably want to find some sort of offline editor. I like this one for the Mac called Cocoa JSON Editor. It's a really good tool for looking at the structure of your JSON data, and it's excellent for working offline. It's even great for working online, but since I found the JSON Online Editor, I don't really use it as much as I used to.</p>

<p>Then there is a PC version here called JSONPad. It's not quite a slick as Cocoa JSON Editor, but it will do if you're on a PC. There are other tools that you can use to add some JSON functionality to your browsers. There's a great tool called JSONView, available for Firefox at this URL, and in the Chrome web store at this URL right here. So these are both tools that will expand the capabilities of your browser to be able to see some of the JSON files directly. So when you pull your JSON document to your browser, it's going to look really nice, and you're going to be able to visualize it a lot better.</p>

<p>Finally, I really want to show you a tool that I use all the time in my WordPress installations. It's called the WordPress JSON API. It hasn't been updated in a few years, but it's still a super-awesome tool. This is a great tool for pulling your JSON data out of WordPress, such as your articles, your categories, and your posts, and converting them into JSON data that you can actually use in other applications. JSON has gotten very popular as a way of sharing data, and the lists of tools available is quite rich, so make sure you take the time to explore some of these tools. They'll make working with JSON and JavaScript objects a lot easier.</p>
