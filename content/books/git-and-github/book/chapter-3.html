            <div class="main-content">

                                                                 <h2 id="initializing-a-repository">3.1 Initializing a repository</h2>

<p>Once you have Git installed and configured, the next step is to initialize Git in a project, essentially to tell Git to start tracking things in this Git project. And the way we are going to do that is with another Git command, which is git space I-N-I-T, init, short for initialize. So we are going to tell Git to initialize the project to get everything ready to start doing its tracking. Now the first thing we have to decide is where we want to put this project. So what I am going to do is I am going to put it inside my Documents folder--you can put yours absolutely anywhere you want--but inside my Documents folder, I am going to open that up, and I am going to create a new folder, and I am going to call it first_git_project, and this is going to be the folder that I am going to use to track, it's going to be my example folder.</p>

<p>Now, I am also going to wanted to go there from the command line. So if I'm inside my user directory, and then I should be able to change into my Documents directory, and then into that first_git_project directory, so now I am inside that folder, right, I am actually right here, right inside that folder from the command line. So from here, inside the root of my project, this is where I need to do my Git initialize, so git init, and this will tell Git, set up this as your homebase, make this a Git repository, and track all the files that come and go, the changes that are made inside this directory, things outside this directory, it's not concerned about, things in this directory, Git will be aware of, and it doesn't matter how deeply nested they are, Git is going to watch for them.</p>

<p>So you can see it comes up and tells you Initialized empty Git repository in, and then it gives you the full path to get to that directory, and you can see that it also added .git, that's where it's actually going to do all of its storing and tracking. We are going to look at that directory closer in the next movie, but that's it, that's all there it is to telling Git hey Git, this is going to be a directory where you need to do your tracking.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-where-git-files-are-stored">3.2 Understanding where Git files are stored</h2>

<p>In the last movie, we initialized Git with our first_git_project. I want us to look at what that did and also understand where Git stores the files that it uses to do version control on our project. You can see that I have got the first_git_project directory open here in the Finder, and you can see that it's empty, actually it appears to be empty, it's not in fact empty. If we come to the command line, I can use the UNIX ls command to list what's in that directory, you can see that that's empty, on Windows that would be the dir command. I can pass in a special option here which is -la, and that will show me the hidden dot files as well, and that's any file that has a dot in front of it is normally going to be hidden.</p>

<p>So .git is a directory that is created by that initialize command. And this directory is a directory where Git stores all of its tracking information. Now that's all of its tracking information, it doesn't matter how deep down in other folders that we've got files going on, they are always going to be stored at the top level of our project inside this .git directory. You can think of it as Git's workspace where Git does everything that it's going to do, and if we wanted to remove Git and remove version control from our project, well, then it would just be a simple matter of removing this .git directory.</p>

<p>If we remove that, then suddenly Git is no longer tracking our project. Obviously, we don't want to do that at this point. Let's take a look at what's inside that directory, ls -la .git, and we can see a list of the files and folders that Git uses while it's doing its tracking. Now again this is Git's workspace, you don't want to come in here and start messing around and changing things, leave it alone, let Git manage these files and let it put things where they need to be. The only exception to that would be the config file, that's the only thing that you would really ever come in here and either take a look at or even possibly edit.</p>

<p>This is for our project level configuration. Now we have an interface through Git that we saw in the Configuration chapter where we don't have to come in here and edit it directly, you can just use git commands to set the different values that you need. But if you did ever need to, that's where this file is located. Everything else, you want to leave alone. Now again, I want to just emphasize the point that everything that Git does is going to be stored in this single top-level directory, that's very different from svn. If you've worked with svn before, svn puts little tracking files in every single directory down the line.</p>

<p>So if you wanted to remove svn, you have to go through and actually pull out those .svn files from every single directory so that it will stop tracking those. Git doesn't do that, Git puts them all right here in one place at the top level. Now that we understand where Git maintains information about our project, let's go ahead and create our first commit so that git can start tracking things inside of our project.</p>

<h2 id="performing-your-first-commit">3.3 Performing your first commit</h2>

<h2 id="writing-commit-messages">3.4 Writing commit messages</h2>

<h2 id="viewing-the-commit-log">3.5 Viewing the commit log</h2>

<p>Now that we've made our first commit, and we've talked about how to write good commit messages, let's take a look at where those commit messages show up by viewing the commit log. The way that we do that is with git log, very common sense, and this will show us the log of commits that have taken place so far, right now there is only one. If there have been more than one then we would see them listed one after another. Now each one of these commits has some basic parts to it. So here it is, I am going to highlight it, we've got the commit ID, this is the identifier for this commit, we'll talk more about that a little while later.</p>

<p>But each commit has a unique ID, that's what this number is here, it tells the Author of the commit, you can see that it pulled this information from my global configuration. So that's how it knew who was making this commit, that's why that was the very first configuration that we did, it's very important to do when you first set up your Git Repo, put in your information so that it can tell with each commit who is making the commit, and then the date that the commit was made and then the message. Now if we'd had a longer message here then of course, it would have one line followed by a space followed by a multi-line message that was below that.</p>

<p>So this is the way to see what's happened in the past in a project. So, for example, if I am collaborating with team members on a project, and we all are making commits to a single repository, if I want to log on in the morning, and I want to see the changes that they've made, and I want to take a look at what those are, then I use git log to look and see what changes they've committed. Now I can then go in and view detail on any one of these if I want to get a little more information. But the commit log uses those commit messages which hopefully are very descriptive to let me know what has changed about the project.</p>

<p>Now there are a number of options that you can use with log, we'd use git help log. We can bring the manual page up that will show you what a lot of those are. I am going to show you just a couple of them real quick. So if we use git and then log with -n followed by a number it will limit the number of commits that it returns to us. Now I only have one commit, so if I say git -n 1 it returns that single commit, same thing if I say git 2, it returns just this single commit. Let's go ahead and put git 0, which is kind of silly, but that will return no commits. So you can see that it limits the number of commits that git returned to us.</p>

<p>So if we only want to look at the most recent five, we can use this to see just the most recent five. We also have the ability to specify the time periods that commits took place. So git log --since=, and I'll put in a date that is going to be everything since that date, and you see nothing comes up, but if I do it from the day before my last commit, then you see everything since that date does pop up, and that commit shows up. Same thing with until, let's go ahead and just do come back to this one, and I'll edit since to say until, so everything leading up until the 15th of June shows up.</p>

<p>If I change it to the 14th then the commit doesn't show up, because the commit was made on the 15th. So I can use since and until, and I can use them both together, so if we want to just see commits between a certain range. Notice that I have the Author here, I can also say that I only want to see commits by a certain Author. Author= and then in quotes or without quotes, I can put just part of the name that I want to look for. Look for Author that is Kevin, and you'll see that it brings up my commit. But if I had another person in here, let's say it's Joe, then of course it doesn't find anyone with commits named Joe. This kind of searching in the Author field can also be done in the commit message field using grep, that's very handy.</p>

<p>We can use grep, that's for a regular expression search. So global regular expression search is what it stands for, and we'll put it inside quotes, and let's say we want to search for everything that has Init in it. And we'll search the commit messages for any text in the commit message that matches the regular expression that you've put here so that can be very handy. If we want to look for changes that took place where someone fixed a bug, all right, we can look at all of the bug fixes. If we want to look for every time someone added something happening to do with JavaScript, we can search for JavaScript changes, see what pops up there. So once again you can see why having good commit messages is important because then we have the ability to do things like use grep when searching those log files.</p>
